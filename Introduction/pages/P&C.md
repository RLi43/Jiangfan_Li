### Exploration and Achievement of Planning Algorithm under specific goal

指定优化目标下的运动规划算法探索与实现

A summer intern in [Aqrose Technology]( http://www.aqrose.com/ ), a company major in AI for robotics and automation. During the summer of 2019, I worked on planning algorithm of the robot. 

Since a 6-axis Fanuc robot doesn’t give enough detail about its algorithms, we don’t know the accurate trajectory that robot will take, which makes it dangerous to operate in industry site. Therefore, I worked on an algorithm that have enough distance away from the obstacles to make sure that the robot won’t hit them.(Meanwhile, there’s another colleague worked on experiments to conjecture the algorithm in black box.)

I learned about planning algorithm by [Planning Algorithms]( http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/ ). After reading some papers, algorithms, finally I decided to use BIT* as the main algorithm. I set some penalization for short distance to obstacles.

Here’s the [detailed report.pdf(Chinese)](..\files\report of summer intern(Chinese).pdf) and [PPT]( https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/decae61280884d46948e/ ) and a [essential version PPT]( https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/a575d20f2ca749b0b7c3/ ).

### Minor-Subject Courses and Projects

####   Modern Human Factors - Project IHOS

IHOS is a project about an app to offer better experience in hospital.

![](..\files\Project IHOS\IHOS.jpg)
> After discussion in group, we find that there are problems within the existing medical procedure so we decide to choose it as our topic. Our project aims at solving the problems during a medical procedure that are inconvenient for patients and some also make patients uncomfortable, for instance, the repeat payments and the test rooms hard to find. Our target users, the patients want to spend less time, have a convenient and comfortable medical procedure. However, the information they need is provided by the system so they have no access to optimize it. It may be a solution that they remember all the rooms’ positions, but it is definitely another burden for them.

Under this goal, we did some user study, comparative analysis, then we decided our target users, requirements of our product. Next, we had brain storm to set up our conceptual design and display it with low-fidelity prototype. After heuristic evaluation by ourselves and other groups, we refined our design and created our high-fidelity prototype with Justinmind. Finally we did user testing and concluded this project.
